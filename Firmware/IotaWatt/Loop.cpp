 * Scheduler/Dispatcher support functions.
 * 
 * The main loop steps through and samples the channels at the millisecond level.  It invokes samplePower()
 * which samples one or more waves and updates the corresponding data buckets.  After each sample, there 
 * are a few milliseconds before the next AC zero crossing, so we try to do everything else during that
 * interval. Bingo time is set as the micros() time when sampling should be resumed.
 * 
 * The WiFi server is invoked each time through the loop to check for work.
 * 
 * Other activities are organized as Services that are scheduled and dispatched in Loop during the half-cycle
 * downtime. This mechanism schedules at a resolution of one millisecond, and dispatches during the optimal 
 * time period between AC cycles.  To preserve context and synchronization, each Service is coded as a 
 * state-machine. They must be well behaved and should try to run for less than a few milliseconds and/or
 * relinquish at Bingo time. That isn't always possible and doesn't do any real harm if they run over
 * occasionally as it just reduces the sampling frequency a bit.
 * 
 * Services return a value that is used to set their reschedule time as follows:
 * 0 - Do not reschedule, deallocate the Service Block.
 * 1 - Set to redispatch immediately.
 * 2-1000 value is milliseconds to delay before redispatch.
 * > 1000 value is UNIXtime of requested redispatch.
 * So if a service just wants to relinquish in deference to sampling but is not finished with its
 * business, just return 1 to be redispatched at the next available opportunity.
 * 
 * The schedule itself is kept as an ordered list of control blocks in ascending order of time + priority
 * called serviceQueue. Loop invokes the service with the highest priority that is dispatchable.
 * 
 * The following two functions are used to maintain the serviceQueue.
 * 
 * NewService creates a new serviceBlock that is immediately dispatchable. This is used to create an
 * instance of a Service and is mostly used at startup.  Ad-hoc Services can be created as well at any
 * time and they can terminate by simply returning zero.
 * 
 * AddService is the workhorse.  It inserts a serviceBlock into the serviceQueue in the appropriate
 * order based on its scheduleTime and priority.  When Services are dispatched, they are removed 
 * from the serviceQueue and then reinserted into the serviceQueue upon return using AddService.
